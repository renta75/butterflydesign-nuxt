                    <h2>WHERE WE CAME FROM</h2>
                    <p>
                      Butterfly Design was born in a beautiful European country called Croatia. A small place with worldwide recognition for its natural beauty and the striking Adriatic Sea. This was the starting point that inspired us to take inspiration from art made by nature, just like butterflies. Nature creates extraordinary beings that combine beauty and functionality just as we combine those elements in every digital product we create.
